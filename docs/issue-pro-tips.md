Issues Pro Tips
---------------

* **Check existing issues** for your issue. Duplicating an issue is slower for both parties so search through open and closed issues to see if what you’re running into has been addressed already.
* **Be clear** about what your problem is: what was the **expected outcome**, what **happened** instead? Detail how someone else can **recreate** the problem.
* **Provide screenshots** to illustrate the problem.
* **Paste error output or logs** in your issue or in a Gist. If pasting them in the issue, wrap it in three backticks: ` ``` ` so that it renders nicely.
