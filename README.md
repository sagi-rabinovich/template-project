Great! Here are some steps to smoothen the process.

3. **Open Pull Requests** - [further reading](docs/open-pull-requests.md)
4. **Merge** - If your reqest was approved- Hurray! it will be merged to the main branch. If not, no sweat, you are more than welcome to use the code as you please, and continue to contribute in any way you choose.
